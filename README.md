# Version Control and Collaboration

## Version Control - using SVG from previous assignment 

* These svg icons are referenced from [link](http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~clx205/drawing/svg/index.html)

* In my previous assignment, I did not have svg sprite but in this assignment I have updated my code and included each icon's individual svg file and svg sprite 
    * svg sprite is titled _symbols.svg_

### New SVG symbol
* Work flow explanation
1. Forked and cloned repository from instructor's [svg icon system][jclayton]

[jclayton]: https://github.com/jclayton/classical-elements/

2. Forked repository can be found in my [_github_](https://github.com/carolinelxy/classical-elements)

3. Modified instructor's ["fire"](https://github.com/jclayton/classical-elements/blob/master/fire.svg) icon using Adobe Illustrator 

4. Added the modified icon to my system of [icons](https://github.com/carolinelxy/vcc)
