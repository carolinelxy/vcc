## Version Control - using SVG from previous assignment 

* These svg icons are referenced from [link](http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~clx205/drawing/svg/index.html)

* In my previous assignment, I did not have svg sprite but in this assignment I have updated my code and included each icon's individual svg file and svg sprite 
    * svg sprite is titled _symbols.svg_
